angularjs-labs
==============

These are lab exercises for a course I teach on AngularJS.

For each lab,
1) generate a directory of files for lab n by
   entering "node genlab.js labn.txt
2) cd to the labn directory
3) enter "npm install" to install all the Node.js dependencies
   (proceed to the next step while this is running)
4) edit all the files containing "Lab:" comments
5) enter "grunt" to start the server
6) browse localhost:3000 to verify that the app works
