mod\.directive\('cbDigitsOnly'
0
//Lab: Study the "cbDigitsOnly" directive below.  It is useful in
//     input elements that should only allow digits to be entered.
//     Note that the only directive defintion object property needed is "link".
//     This link function only uses the parameters scope and element.
//     It rejects all keyDown events for keys that
//     are not digits or for navigation.

mod\.directive\('cbIdentifier'
11
//Lab: Define a directive named "cbIdentifier" that rejects
//     all keydown events for characters that are not valid
//     identifier characters and are not navigation keys.
//     Use the isIdentifier and isNavigation functions above.
//     This should be very similar to the cbDigitsOnly directive.
//     Note where it is used in edit-book.html.

file features/directives/dialog.js
mod\.directive\('cbDialog'
11
//Lab: Define a directive named "cbDialog".
//     It opens a Twitter Bootstrap modal containing a specified
//     header, content, and buttons for the user to press.
//     Allow this directive to be used as either an attribute or element.
//     Use the HTML template dialog.html in the features/directives directory.
//     This directive should replace the element on which it appears.
//     It should use tranclusion to insert the content of the element
//     where it appears into its template.
//     Use an isolate scope that contains these properties:
//     * btnMap - by reference
//     * busyRef - by reference
//     * title - by value
//     * data - by reference
//     See the comments above for a description of each of these.
