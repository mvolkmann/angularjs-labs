    //     to the DOM element that is the root of the dialog HTML.

    //     produces a template, and returns a function that
    //     takes a scope object and links the template to the scope.

    //        in the dialog body, a paragraph (p)

    //     3) clicks the Cancel button
    //     4) tests that the associated function was executed
